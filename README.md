# Advent of Code 2024

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

These are my solutions for the year 2024 using PHP 8.3 (might switch to 8.4 along the way).

As requested by the creator of Advent of Code, I will only link the daily puzzles, but will not include the puzzle texts or my input files.

See [puzzles.md](puzzles.md) for the list of puzzles and my progress, and [journals.md](journals.md) for my daily thoughts.

Happy coding, everyone!
